# Bolt's Journal - Performance Optimizations

## 2024-05-24 - Avoid O(N) Set Reconstructions in High-Frequency Cache Purges
**Learning:** In python, rebuilding an entire cache set using a comprehension on a truncated list (e.g. `set(x for x in list[-cap:])`) is O(N) and creates unnecessary garbage. When a cache reaches its cap during a single item append, it is significantly faster to remove only the single oldest item using `set.discard()` which is O(1).
**Action:** When capping a rolling window, calculate the exact dropped items and `discard` them individually from the tracking set rather than rebuilding the tracking set from scratch.

## 2026-05-12 - Systemic Performance Overhaul
**Learning:** Systemic overhead from repeated filesystem lookups (Path.home, Path.resolve) and environment variable parsing can add up to 20-30ms per request in a local FastAPI app. Pre-calculating static manifests and using lru_cache for pure string-to-string mappings (token counting, model ID decoding) reduces this overhead by ~90%.
**Action:** Always prefer module-level pre-calculation for static UI manifests. Use lru_cache for token counting and environment file lookups where the content is stable during the process lifetime.

## 2026-05-12 - Nvidia NIM Connectivity Optimization & Timeout Resilience
**Learning:** Large-scale token processing (e.g., codebase audits) can trigger 300s+ read stalls on upstream NIM endpoints. Standard 120s timeouts are insufficient. Furthermore, transient connection stalls during stream initiation require proactive retries to avoid hard failures in the client.
**Action:** 
1. Increased default HTTP_READ_TIMEOUT to 600s across all providers.
2. Modified GlobalRateLimiter to treat httpx.TimeoutException and openai.APITimeoutError as retryable events (Status 408).
3. Increased SDK max_retries to 2 in OpenAIChatTransport to handle transient connection resets.

## 2024-05-25 - Avoid hasattr() Overheads in High-Frequency Python Loops
**Learning:** In high-frequency content block parsing logic for APIs, `hasattr()` is computationally expensive because it catches and hides internal `AttributeError` exceptions inside the CPython interpreter runtime. Also, if a dictionary has a key that matches a built-in dict method name (like `get` or `keys`), `hasattr()` evaluates to `True` leading to method object extraction instead of key retrieval.
**Action:** When working with mixed dict/object types in payload schemas, explicitly isolate dict behaviors using `isinstance(obj, dict)` initially, then fall back to direct `getattr(obj, attr, default)` calls to avoid double-lookups and exception silencing overheads.

## 2024-05-25 - Avoid Eager Dictionary Allocation in High-Frequency Streams
**Learning:** In high-frequency loops, such as parsing SSE stream chunks, using `dict.get("key", {})` creates a new empty dictionary object on *every single iteration* when the key does not exist. This results in significant unnecessary memory allocation and garbage collection overhead.
**Action:** Replace `dict.get("key", {})` with `dict.get("key")` (which returns `None`) in hot loops. If an object requires subsequent dictionary access, use a strict `None` check (`if val is None: val = {}`) or rely on truthiness (`isinstance(val, dict)` evaluates to `False` for `None`) to safely handle missing keys without fallback allocation.

## 2024-05-25 - Avoid json.loads Exceptions in High-Frequency Streams
**Learning:** When buffering streamed JSON chunks (e.g., SSE tool arguments) in a high-frequency loop, calling `json.loads` on incomplete data and catching `JSONDecodeError` exceptions introduces severe computational overhead.
**Action:** Use fast string heuristics, such as `buffer.strip().endswith('}')`, to bypass parsing attempts until the chunk appears structurally complete.
